# Into Madness

You descend into The Realm. Endless floor after endless floor, there is loot to be discovered and enemies to slay. Your sanity may be harder to keep a handle on than would be expected. Choose your battles carefully and keep in mind that sometimes you're having an unlucky 

# Game Notes

This is just a place to write out some notes, reading them would be helpful for devs of the game, but also to players as well..

## Stats

* PATK -- physical attack, damage of physical attacks
* MATK -- magical attack, damage of magical attacks
* PSPD -- physical attack speed, how fast you can use your physical weapons
* MSPD -- magical attack speed, how fast your magical
* PDEF -- physical defense, reduction of incoming physical damage
* MDEF -- magical defense, reduction of incoming magic damage
* MSPD -- movement speed
* ABLT -- ability effectiveness

All stats are based on totals. A weapon with a high stat total can typically be assumed to be good in some way, though maybe not always the ideal way for using the weapon itself.

## HUD

The hud displays several things.
* Your primary attack weapon
* The status etc of your secondary attack weapon
* The charge status of your ability
* The sanity meter
* The charge status of using an action

## Equips, Moves, and Actions

There's two different things that can be used in battle, moves and actions. 

Moves are moderated by PSPD or MSPD, depending on if the equip for that button press is a (P) physical or (M)magical item. Moves are typically fairly fast to execute and recharge within a reasonable time as well. At first you can store up to 2 charges per physical item, or 1 charge per magical item. Your ability is only 1 charge. More charges can be added by high stat gear. Each multiple of 10 in MSPD or PSPD or ABLT increases the number of charges by 1, up to a maximum of 3.

The controller layout during combat is planned as so:

* X -- primary attack
* Z -- menu (action)
* Z+X -- secondary attack

In the menu

Within the menu, X is confirm and Z is to go back (or exit).

In the overworld, the controller layout is:

* Z -- gear and equip menu
* X -- item menu

Gear must be equipped to use them, but provide a selection of moves and actions, depending on the gear. Most weapons have 3 moves and/or actions in total. Most armor pieces have 1 action

If the same action is provided from multiple pieces of gear, the action is improved. The same move provided from gear does not stack or offer any improvement.

## Parry

There is a unique parry mechanic. It is basically a guage which starts slow and then speeds up, and the idea is to get the gauuge to be within a certain precise point near the end. A successful parry will result in a percentage of damage being reflected back at the enemy, taking no damage yourself, and the parried attack doesn't consume a move charge.
